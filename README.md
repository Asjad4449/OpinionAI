Welcome to OpinionAI, an innovative AI-powered tool that generates dynamic conversational debates and analyzes the sentiment behind them. Built by Asjad, Hanzala Nadeem, Humaiz Akber, and Uqba Nadeem for CodeFest 25, OpinionAI brings discussions to life while uncovering the emotions within the text. Whether you're exploring hot topics or diving into the tone of arguments, OpinionAI offers a unique blend of creativity and insight.
OpinionAI combines two powerful features to create a one-of-a-kind experience:

Conversational Debates: Input any topic, and OpinionAI crafts a lively, back-and-forth debate featuring diverse perspectives.
Sentiment Analysis: It then digs deeper, analyzing the emotional tone of the topic whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral and gives us the description of what people think about on social media .
This fusion of debate generation and sentiment analysis makes OpinionAI a standout tool for exploring both what is said and how it’s felt.

OpinionAI was born during CodeFest 25 that challenged us to think outside the box. Our team—Asjad, Hanzala Nadeem, Humaiz Akber, and Uqba Nadeem—came together to create this project, and we’re excited to keep refining it beyond the event.
